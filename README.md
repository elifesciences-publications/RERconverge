# RERconverge

RERconverge is a set of software written in R that estimates the correlation between relative evolutionary rates of genes and the evolution of a convergent binary or continuous trait across a phylogeny.

### This code is associated with the paper from Kowalczyk et al., "Pan-mammalian analysis of molecular constraints underlying extended lifespan". eLife, 2020. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.51089


## Getting Started

Please refer to the [Install page](https://github.com/nclark-lab/RERconverge/wiki/Install) for detailed instructions to **install** RERconverge from scratch. For more information on running RERconverge, please see the [full documentation](https://github.com/nclark-lab/RERconverge/blob/master/RERconverge-master.pdf) and [R vignettes](https://github.com/nclark-lab/RERconverge/wiki/Vignettes) for a nice step-by-step tutorial.

### Quick Start
```
library(devtools)
install_github("nclark-lab/RERconverge")
```
To run an analysis you will need:
1) a trees file: a tab-delimited files with gene names and Newick format trees for each gene.
Tree topologies must be the same for all genes, and at least one tree must contain all species in the dataset.
We provide trees files for several clades [here](https://bit.ly/2J2QBnj).

2) information about phenotypes for species included in the dataset. 
 
For a *binary trait analysis*, this can either be in the form of:
* a vector (in R) of species to include in the foreground.
* a tree object (made in R from a Newick tree) where branches are non-zero only for foreground lineages.
* a tree topology and phenotype information to use for interactive foreground selection

For a *continuous trait analysis*, this should be:
* a named vector (in R) of quantitative phenotype values, where the names represent the species to which the phenotypes correspond.


### Output

Running RERconverge will produce the following outputs:
1) an object containing, for each gene, the correlation between its relative evolutionary rate and the trait of interest, along with the estimated p-value and FDR
2) an object containing, for each gene, its relative evolutionary rate for each branch of the phylogeny, which can be used in the included visualization scripts (e.g., to illustrate the difference in relative evolutionary rate between foreground and background branches)
